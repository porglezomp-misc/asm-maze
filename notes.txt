Keyboard checking:

- Scan all of the /dev/input/eventN devices
- Use ioctl EVIOCGBIT(0, sizeof(evbit)) to check for EV_KEY
- If it's set, then use EVIOCGBIT(EV_KEY, sizeof(keybit)) to check if interesting keys are supported

UPDATE: This doesn't work!
My logitech mouse claims to support a bunch of keyboard keys, so it gets detected.
Instead, we just open all of the event devices and read from *all* of them.

Random selection:

Assume we're picking a direction, and some are potentially invalid.
Can we handle this by moving clockwise from a random selection?

This looks like it behaves randomly!

Audio:

Need to enable OSS audio emulation using

$ sudo modprobe snd_pcm_oss
